# Reinforcement Learning Game Project

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the application of Reinforcement Learning using
two different approaches:

1. A **custom-built game environment** implemented using Pygame, where
   **Q-Learning** is used to train the agent.
2. A **Gymnasium built-in environment**, where a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**
   is implemented to train the agent.

This design follows academic recommendations and allows comparison between
tabular and deep reinforcement learning methods.

## Algorithms Used
- Q-Learning (Custom Environment)
- Deep Q-Network (Gymnasium Environment)

## How to Run
### 1. Prerequisites
Make sure Python 3.9+ is installed along with required libraries:

### Custom Environment (Q-Learning)
```bash
python custom_env_qlearning/train_qlearning.py
